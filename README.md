## AI Operations Assistant (Propose-Then-Confirm)

The AI Assistant operates under a strict **Propose-Then-Confirm** model. It has **zero direct write tools** in its model schema and cannot alter records on its own.

### What the AI Assistant CAN Do:
1. **Tasks**: Propose scheduled follow-up calls, visits, packing, or dispatch tasks with automatic Asia/Kolkata date resolution (defaults to 10:00 AM – 10:30 AM IST).
2. **Customers**: Propose adding wholesale/retail leads, updating contact persons or stages (`New`, `Contacted`, `Interested`, `Sample sent`, `Negotiation`, `Ordered`, `Not interested`), setting next follow-up dates, and logging call outcomes.
3. **Planning**: Propose daily morning briefings and weekly target plans.
4. **Festivals & Meta Ads**: Propose festival calendar events and Meta ad planning drafts.

### What the AI Assistant CANNOT Do (Blocked by Scope):
* Delete or move records to Trash directly.
* Restore records or run bulk imports.
* Process orders, accept payments, modify stock or pricing.
* Send direct messages (WhatsApp, Email, SMS, Push) to customers.
* Modify automation rules, team members, or system settings.

### How Undo Works:
* Every executed action captures the before-state and creates an audit entry in `activity_logs` as `by AI assistant for {member}`.
* The member has a **30-minute undo window**.
* **Concurrency Protection**: If another member has modified the record since the AI action, undo is safely blocked to protect human edits.

### Privacy Notice:
* Spoken audio and customer notes are processed through the **private enterprise Gemini tier**.
* Voice recordings are processed in memory and **never saved to disk or stored in Firestore**.
* Customer data is never used to train public AI models.

### Troubleshooting Voice:
* **Android Chrome / PC Chrome**: Use either browser dictation or the Gemini audio path.
* **No Tamil Voice on Device**: If the device lacks a Tamil voice pack (`ta-IN`), the assistant displays text on screen rather than mispronouncing Tamil with an English voice.
* **Voice Confirmation**: Spoken confirmation (`Confirm`, `சரி`, `ஆமா`) is accepted only during the 5-second window after speech finishes for low-risk actions. High-risk actions require a physical tap on the confirmation card.
